# When dealing with an account that involves multiple types of
# connections, such as IMAP and POP3 which both use SMTP for sending,
# we augment the account name in the string with a label to help
# clarify to the user which account type they are dealing with. For
# most users, the same password will be used for the IMAP server and
# the SMTP server, and they will only ever see the IMAP or POP3 label.
# But some users with unusual server configurations will also see the
# SMTP variant. These unusual users will probably have received
# specific instructions from their ISP that involve use of the
# protocol names. In general we expect that localizers will want to
# leave the protocol names as-is since they are technical protocol
# names, but it may make sense to place the name of the protocol
# before the account type for certain languages.

# Note that the account name is displayed as a string that is
# displayed in its entirety, so you don't need to worry about clipping
# or ellipses.
